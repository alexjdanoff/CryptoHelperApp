# Crypto Helper App

The application consists of two screens. The first screen displays a list of cryptocurrencies containing the current value and the minimum and maximum value for the last period. Prices are updated in real-time and are accompanied by animation.

By clicking on one of the coins, we will go to the second screen, where a candlestick chart with the data of this coin is displayed. The chart displays fluctuations in the price of a coin with an interval of 30 seconds.


## What I used:

- Architecture - MVVM
- User interface - SwiftUI
- Database - Realm
- iOS 16: Charts

The API was provided by the company for which this test application was written.
